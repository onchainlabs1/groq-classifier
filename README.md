## üöÄ The Sub-60 Minute Challenge

<div align="center">
<table><tr><td>
<h3>‚è±Ô∏è Can we build a complete, production-ready AI application in under 60 minutes?</h3>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

This project was created as a speed-coding challenge to test the limits of AI-assisted development. With only **Cursor AI** as a development tool and a strict time limit of **60 minutes**, the goal was to build a fully-functional application that combines:

- ü§ñ A LangChain-powered LLM chatbot using Groq API
- üß† A scikit-learn ML classifier with multiple categories
- üìä Data visualization and analytics
- üì± A polished, user-friendly interface
- ‚úÖ Complete with tests and documentation

**The result?** A complete, production-ready application built in less than one hour of pure development time. This challenge demonstrates how modern AI-powered development tools are revolutionizing the software development lifecycle.

## üéÆ Live Demo

Try the application live on Streamlit Cloud:

## ‚ú® What Was Built in Under 60 Minutes

The challenge produced a surprisingly complete application with:

### üß† Core AI Features
- **LLM Agent**: Enterprise-grade question answering using Groq's llama3-70b-8192 model
- **Text Classification**: Multi-category ML classifier using scikit-learn
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Positive/negative sentiment detection
- **Question Recognition**: Automatic detection of questions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Uncertainty detection for low-confidence predictions

### üìä Data & Analytics
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual analytics of classification results
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple texts at once
- **Data Export**: Save and analyze classification results
- **Classifier Statistics**: Visual insights into the ML model

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features
- **Direct API Integration**: Enter Groq API key directly in the interface
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-structured, modular codebase
- **API Examples**: Programmatic usage documentation
- **Automated Tests**: Unit tests for all components
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Full documentation of all features

## üîç Classification Categories

The classifier can instantly identify four different types of text:

- üòä **Positive**: Identifies positive sentiment in text
- üò† **Negative**: Identifies negative sentiment in text
- ‚ùì **Questions**: Identifies queries seeking information
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational**: Identifies factual statements

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API Key (from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onchainlabs1/groq-classifier.git
   cd groq-classifier
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using setup script (recommended)
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   
   # Option 2: Manual setup
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. Enter your Groq API key in the sidebar (if you want to use the LLM features)

## üß© Application Components

Beyond the main classifier interface, this 60-minute challenge produced:

| Component | Command | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Main App** | `streamlit run app.py` | The primary interface for text classification and LLM interaction |
| **Analytics Dashboard** | `streamlit run report.py` | Data visualization and batch processing tools |
| **API Examples** | `python api.py` | Demonstrates programmatic usage |
| **Data Utilities** | `python data_utils.py` | Tools for exporting and analyzing results |

## ‚è±Ô∏è Hour-by-Hour Development

The entire project was built in a single development session, with tasks completed in rapid succession:

| Time | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **0:00-0:10** | Core architecture setup, project structure |
| **0:10-0:20** | ML classification system implementation |
| **0:20-0:30** | LLM integration with Groq API |
| **0:30-0:40** | Streamlit UI and responsive design |
| **0:40-0:50** | Data analytics, visualization, and batch tools |
| **0:50-0:60** | Documentation, tests, and final touches |

## üß™ The Challenge Method

This challenge followed strict rules to accurately test AI-assisted development speed:

1. **Time Limit**: 60 minutes of active development
2. **Single Tool**: Only Cursor AI for code writing/editing
3. **Complete Product**: Must be a fully functional end-to-end application
4. **Quality Standards**: Clean code, documentation, and tests required
5. **No Templates**: Everything created from scratch, no pre-built templates
