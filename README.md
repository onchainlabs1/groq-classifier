## The Cursor AI Challenge

This project was developed as a coding challenge using only **Cursor AI** - an AI-powered code editor. The entire application, including all features, was built in a single development session with AI assistance. This approach demonstrates:

- Rapid prototyping capabilities with AI-assisted development
- Combining modern LLMs with traditional ML techniques
- Building end-to-end applications with minimal time investment
- Creating production-ready code with comprehensive testing and documentation

## Features

- **LLM Agent**: Answers general questions using the llama3-70b-8192 model via Groq API
- **Text Classification**: Analyzes and categorizes text into multiple categories:
  - üòä **Positive**: Identifies positive sentiment in text
  - üò† **Negative**: Identifies negative sentiment in text
  - ‚ùì **Question**: Identifies questions seeking information
  - ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Informational**: Identifies text providing factual information
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface with responsive design and visual feedback
- **Data Analysis Dashboard**: Complete analytics tools with visualizations and batch processing
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides uncertainty detection when classification confidence is low

## Tech Stack

- **[LangChain](https://langchain.com/)**: Framework for working with LLMs
- **[Groq API](https://groq.com/)**: Ultra-fast LLM inference API
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**: Machine learning tools and algorithms
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**: Web application framework for data apps
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)**: Data visualization
- **[Python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)**: Environment variable management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Groq API Key (from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/onchainlabs1/groq-classifier.git
   cd groq-classifier
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using setup script (recommended)
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   
   # Option 2: Manual setup
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Additional Applications

Beyond the main classifier interface, this project includes:

### 1. Analytics Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run report.py
```
Provides detailed metrics, visualizations, and batch processing capabilities.

### 2. Programmatic API Examples
```bash
python api.py
```
Demonstrates how to use the classification system programmatically.

### 3. Data Utilities
```bash
python data_utils.py
```
Tools for exporting classification results and model statistics.

## Development Process

This project was built using Cursor AI to demonstrate how modern AI-assisted development can accelerate creation of complex applications. The entire development process took place in a single session, including:

1. Setting up the core architecture
2. Implementing the ML classification system
3. Building the LLM integration
4. Creating a responsive UI
5. Adding comprehensive testing
6. Implementing data analysis features
7. Writing detailed documentation

This approach showcases the potential of AI-assisted coding for rapid prototyping and development of production-ready applications.

## Documentation

For comprehensive documentation of all features and components, see the [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more sophisticated classification models
